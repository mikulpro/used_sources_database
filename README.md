# Database of Used Information Sources

## Basic information

github name: used_sources_database

Application using REST API for storing your book sources at one place so you can later access them when asked by your Bachelor's thesis leader.

If docker file is running then documentation of API is available at:
```url
http://localhost:5000/swagger/
```

This project is based around RESTing. More information available at:
```url

```

Seminary work in Czech language can be found on the following url:

```
...or in this repository as a standalone .pdf file.

## Docker setup

Docker pulls Postgres Database image and stores DB localy and packs it with our written REST API for POSTing, GETting, PUTting and DELTEing books.

For docker use these two commands:

```shell
docker-compose build
```
...for creating a proper docker image using all needed libraries.

```shell
docker compose up
```
...to run the docker. 

```shell
docker compose down
```
...to stop the docker. 

---------------------------------------------------------

## Testing

We have written unit tests in /testing directory.

To run automatised unit testing first make sure your docker image is up and running, then you can run unit testing using the following command in separate terminal in used_sources_database directory:

```shell
docker exec used_sources_database-app-1 python -m testing.unit_testing
```

This mentioned unit testing can also be used to validate endpoints.

Another tests can be performed using Postman application or built-in swagger. (Filip Stehl√≠k will demonstrate.)

Security testing was done using Bandit.

---------------------------------------------------------

## HTTP communication

Assuming you have the Docker image running on your local device and therfore can connect to it using your localhost IP address whith the default port which is usually 127.0.0.1:5000, HTTP communication with our API works like this...

To view Swagger documentation of all methods u can connect with your browser to:
```url
http://localhost:5000/swagger/
```

All non-swagger communication is done via the route /books/.

To POST a new book to the DB, create a .json file containing information for title, author, type and year and POST it using HTTP request to:
```url
http://localhost:5000/books/books
```

GETting a book from the DB can be done either by specifying the exact ID that shoud be pulled from the DB using:
```url
http://localhost:5000/books/books/<int:id>
```
...or by specifying parameters of the book such as its author:
```url
http://localhost:5000/books/books?params
```

Book record that is already present in the database can be edited by specifying the ID and calling a PUT request with JSON file provided.
```url
http://localhost:5000/books/books/<int:id>
```

In the same way a book can be DELETed by specifying the id.

All unspecified endpoints are described in endpointy.txt
